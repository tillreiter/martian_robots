Specs

The User Input constructor
+ verifies that user input is like defined format (new line seperation, positive coordinate integers, direction (NESW), instruction string)
+ processes first line as grid coordinates of maximum 50 each

+ processes every following 2-line block as robot instructions
++ whose first line sets position (x,y) and a direction (N,E,S,W)
++ whose second line contains string of maximumum 100 instruction letters


The planet constructor
+ lays out a 2-dimensional grid ((x+1) * (y+1)
+ provides checking if position is inside grid functionality
+ provides cell scenting functionality
+ provides cell value checking functionality


The robot constructor
+ puts a robot on grid cell with its direction (if coordinates within defined planet)

+ provides turn left on same cell functionality turns ('L')
+ provides turn right on same cell functionality turns ('R')

+ provides move one cell forward functionality ('F')
++ that marks last cell on grid with 'scent' if robot moves off grid
++ that ignores any instruction that would move it from the grid when it stands on a 'scented' grid point

The program's output
+ tells the position of each robot per line in the format like position input
+ adds 'LOST' to the position if the robot moved off the grid
